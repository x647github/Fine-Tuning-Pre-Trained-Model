# German Traffic Sign Recognition using Fine-Tuned VGG-16

This project fine-tuned the VGG-16 model for classifying images of traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark [(GTSRB)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign) dataset, encompassing 43 classes. The entire dataset (train and test) contains over 50,000 images. The training set alone contains over 39,000 images. 

We used a small version of the GTSRB dataset, which contains just 40 images per class, to demonstrate using a pre-trained model for cases when we may have a limited-size dataset.
